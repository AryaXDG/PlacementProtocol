# 🚀 PlacementProtocol: Technical Prep Tracker

`PlacementProtocol` is a systematic progress tracker and roadmap designed for developers aiming for high-tier technical roles (such as TCS Digital, Prime, and other Product-based SDE roles). It provides a structured path to bridge the gap between foundational logic and advanced competitive programming.

---

## 📌 The Philosophy

The key to cracking technical interviews is not just solving many problems, but mastering specific patterns and maintaining consistency. This tool helps users organize their study plan into three logical tiers, ensuring no critical topics are missed during the preparation phase.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **Tiered Roadmap:** A curated list of problems categorized into three difficulty levels:
    * **Ninja (Foundation):** Logic building, basic patterns, and fundamental array/math operations.
    * **Digital (Standard DSA):** Intermediate optimization, matrix manipulation, and string parsing.
    * **Prime (Elite):** Advanced topics including Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, and Graph theory.

* **Gamified Consistency:** 
    * ❤️ **Life System:** A built-in mechanism to encourage daily participation.
    * 🔥 **Streak Tracker:** Tracks consecutive days of activity to help build a long-term habit.
    * 📊 **Readiness Gauge:** A visual progress bar that calculates your preparedness based on completed tasks.

* **Topic-Wise Breakdown:** Each task includes a problem description, difficulty badge, estimated time, and a direct link to practice on LeetCode.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Flexbox/Grid)
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## 📅 The Roadmap Overview

The roadmap is structured to be completed over a period of 4 to 6 months:

| Tier | Primary Focus | Target Skills |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Ninja** | Foundation | Logic building, bit manipulation, and basic number theory. |
| **Digital** | Optimization | Binary search, sorting, hashing, and sliding windows. |
| **Prime** | Advanced DSA | Recursion, Backtracking, Trees, Graphs, and DP. |

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Start with Ninja Tier:** Build your foundation with basic logic and pattern problems.
2. **Progress to Digital Tier:** Once comfortable, move to intermediate DSA topics.
3. **Challenge Yourself with Prime Tier:** Tackle advanced problems to prepare for top-tier companies.
4. **Track Your Progress:** Mark problems as complete and watch your readiness gauge grow.
5. **Maintain Your Streak:** Stay consistent to keep your streak alive and lives intact.

## 🤝 Credits & Resources

The problems and logic patterns included in this roadmap are curated from industry-standard resources:

* **LeetCode:** Primary platform for problem links.
* **Striver's SDE Sheet:** Inspiration for core DSA patterns.
* **Standard Placement Syllabi:** Used to categorize difficulty tiers.
